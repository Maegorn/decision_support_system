- Depth first:
In order to obtain depth first algorithm instead breath first one we have changend appendleft() to append()
to take last processed node
- A* (h1)
We have defined in class "Solver" the method "sortByCost" that sort by cost the queue
and the method called "setCost" in class "Node" that compute the number of tiles out of place.
The methods are used in method "solve" from the class "Solver"
- A* (h2) 
In the h2 we only changed the method "setCost" in class "Node" to compute the Manhattan distance
